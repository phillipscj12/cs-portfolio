# Artemis Financial Software Security Project

## Client Overview
The client, Artemis Financial, is a financial consulting company that provides savings, retirement, investment, and insurance solutions. Artemis Financial wanted to enhance its software security by conducting a vulnerability assessment and adding secure coding practices to protect sensitive client data.

## Project Summary
- **What I Did Well**: I successfully identified security vulnerabilities and implemented mitigation strategies, such as using encryption (SHA-256) and secure communication with HTTPS. Secure coding ensures the protection of sensitive data, reduces risks, and increases client trust.  
- **Challenges and Learnings**: One of the more challenging parts was conducting the dependency check to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. However, this process taught me how important it is to test code rigorously for security.  
- **Layers of Security**: I added layers of security by using cryptographic hashing, self-signed SSL certificates, and tools like OWASP Dependency-Check for static analysis. In the future, Iâ€™d use automated security tools like SonarQube and dependency scanners to assess and prioritize vulnerabilities.  
- **Ensuring Functionality and Security**: After refactoring the code, I tested it thoroughly to ensure it functioned as expected. I also ran a dependency scan to verify that no additional vulnerabilities were introduced.  
- **Helpful Tools**: Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Java Keytool, and Spring Boot were invaluable for this project. Following industry best practices, like using HTTPS and modular coding, made the process easier and more effective.  
- **Value to Future Employers**: This project showcases my ability to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, implement secure communication, and follow secure coding practices. It highlights my problem-solving skills and knowledge of tools like OWASP and encryption algorithms.
